#Al-Mathurat
A text based Al-Mathurat library

##About
It is so hard to find a working text based Al-Mathurat in the web. People are sharing images instead of free text. So i created this repo.

Thank you [iwani](https://github.com/iwanikhalid) for helping on the arabic text

Feel free to use and do a pull request and feel free to use. No license.

#Usage
To create sqlite database from mathurat_sughra_sqlite.sql, just run `cat mathurat_sughra_sqlite.sql | sqlite3 mathurat.db`

##Contents
1. mathurat_sughra.odt : A raw text based Mathurat Sughra.
2. mathurat_sughra_sqlite.sql : A SQLite databse dump file complete with Bahasa Melayu translations

Currently i only have Sughra version :) Maybe next time will have Kubra also (need help!)

##Good to have (Need help/contributors)
1. Al-Mathurat Kubra
2. More translations, (English?, Indonesia?, Any)
3. Anything related
